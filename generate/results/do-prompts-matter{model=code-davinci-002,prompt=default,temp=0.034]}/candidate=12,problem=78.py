# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# We will use a 2D array to store the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre.
# The first dimension will be the time and the second dimension will be the genre.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][genre] + dp[time - song_time][genre - 1] + dp[time - song_time][genre + 1]
# The first term is the number of ways to reach the time with the same genre as the song.
# The second term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one less than the song.
# The third term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one more than the song.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][genre] + dp[time - song_time][genre - 1] + dp[time - song_time][genre + 1]
# The first term is the number of ways to reach the time with the same genre as the song.
# The second term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one less than the song.
# The third term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one more than the song.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][genre] + dp[time - song_time][genre - 1] + dp[time - song_time][genre + 1]
# The first term is the number of ways to reach the time with the same genre as the song.
# The second term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one less than the song.
# The third term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one more than the song.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][genre] + dp[time - song_time][genre - 1] + dp[time - song_time][genre + 1]
# The first term is the number of ways to reach the time with the same genre as the song.
# The second term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one less than the song.
# The third term is the number of ways to reach the time with the genre one more than the song.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][genre] + dp[time - song_time][genre - 1] + dp[time - song_time][genre + 1]
