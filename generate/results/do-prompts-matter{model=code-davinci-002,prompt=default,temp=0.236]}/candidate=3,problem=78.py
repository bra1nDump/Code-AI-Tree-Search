# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# We can use a 2D array to store the number of playlists of length i and total duration j.
# The number of playlists of length i and total duration j is the sum of the number of playlists of length i-1 and total duration j-k, where k is the duration of the song.
# We can use a 3D array to store the number of playlists of length i, total duration j and last song genre k.
# The number of playlists of length i, total duration j and last song genre k is the sum of the number of playlists of length i-1, total duration j-k and last song genre l, where l is the genre of the song.
