# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# We will use a 2D array to store the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre.
# The first dimension will be the time and the second dimension will be the genre.
# We will use the following recurrence relation to fill the array:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][k] for all k != j
# This means that we can reach the current time and genre by reaching the current time with any other genre.
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre without using the current song.
# This can be done by using the following recurrence relation:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][j]
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre using the current song.
# This can be done by using the following recurrence relation:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][0]
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre using the current song and any other song.
# This can be done by using the following recurrence relation:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][k] for all k != j
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre using the current song and any other song.
# This can be done by using the following recurrence relation:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][k] for all k != j
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre using the current song and any other song.
# This can be done by using the following recurrence relation:
# dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] + dp[i - t][k] for all k != j
# We will also need to add the number of ways to reach the current time with the current genre using the current song and any other song.
