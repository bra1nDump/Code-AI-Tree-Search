# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# We will use a 2D array to store the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre.
# The first dimension will be the time and the second dimension will be the genre.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][1] + dp[time - song_time][2] + dp[time - song_time][3]
# This formula is based on the fact that we can reach a certain time with a certain genre by reaching a time that is
# song_time less than the current time with any of the other genres.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][1] + dp[time - song_time][2] + dp[time - song_time][3]
# This formula is based on the fact that we can reach a certain time with a certain genre by reaching a time that is
# song_time less than the current time with any of the other genres.
# We will use the following formula to calculate the number of ways to reach a certain time with a certain genre:
# dp[time][genre] = dp[time - song_time][1] + dp[time - song_time][2] + dp[time - song_time][3]

# song_time less than the current time with any of the other genres.
