# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# We can use a 2D array to store the number of playlists that end with a song of a certain genre.
# For example, if we have 3 songs, the array would look like this:
#
#   1 2 3
# 1 0 0 0
# 2 0 0 0
# 3 0 0 0
#
# We can then use the following recurrence relation to fill the array:
#
#   1 2 3
# 1 0 0 0
# 2 0 0 0
# 3 0 0 0
#
# dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i][k]) for k != j
#
# The final answer is the sum of all the elements in the last row.
