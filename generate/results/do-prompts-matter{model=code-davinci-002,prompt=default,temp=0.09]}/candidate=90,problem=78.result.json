        "\n# Solution\n\n# This solution is based on the idea of dynamic programming.\n# We will use a 3D array to store the number of playlists of length i,\n# ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k.\n# We will then use this array to calculate the number of playlists of length i+1,\n# ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k.\n# The number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# is equal to the sum of the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k-t,\n# for all t in the range [1, 15].\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k.\n# We will then subtract the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# from the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j-1.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j+1.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j+2.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j-2.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j+3.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j-3.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j+4.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j-4.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# if the song of genre j is the same as the song of genre j+5.\n# We will then add the number of playlists of length i, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n# to the number of playlists of length i+1, ending with a song of genre j, and with a total duration of k,\n"
