# Solution

# This solution is based on the idea that the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ (where $t_i$, $t_j$ and $t_k$ are the durations of the songs of the three different genres).

# This is because the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j-t_k$.

# However, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_i$, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_k$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k-t_i$, and the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_k$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k-t_j$.

# Thus, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ (where $t_i$, $t_j$ and $t_k$ are the durations of the songs of the three different genres).

# This is because the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j-t_k$.

# However, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_j$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_i$, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i-t_k$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k-t_i$, and the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j-t_k$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k-t_j$.

# Thus, the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ (where $t_i$, $t_j$ and $t_k$ are the durations of the songs of the three different genres).

# This is because the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_i$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_j$ plus the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T-t_k$ plus the number of ways to create a
