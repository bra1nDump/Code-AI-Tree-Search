# Solution 1
# This solution is based on the idea that the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the sum of the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T - t_i$ for all $i$ such that $t_i \le T$.
# This is because we can create a playlist of length $T$ by adding a song of length $t_i$ to a playlist of length $T - t_i$.
# We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# Let $dp[i]$ be the number of ways to create a playlist of length $i$.
# Then, $dp[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{n} dp[i - t_j]$ if $i - t_j \ge 0$ and $dp[i] = 0$ otherwise.
# We can use a prefix sum to calculate the sum in $O(1)$ time.
# The time complexity is $O(nT)$.

# Solution 2
# This solution is based on the idea that the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T$ is equal to the sum of the number of ways to create a playlist of length $T - t_i$ for all $i$ such that $t_i \le T$ and the genre of the song is different from the genre of the last song in the playlist.
# This is because we can create a playlist of length $T$ by adding a song of length $t_i$ to a playlist of length $T - t_i$ if the genre of the song is different from the genre of the last song in the playlist.
# We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
# Let $dp[i][j]$ be the number of ways to create a playlist of length $i$ such that the genre of the last song in the playlist is $j$.
# Then, $dp[i][j] = \sum_{k=1}^{n} dp[i - t_k][k]$ if $i - t_k \ge 0$ and $dp[i][j] = 0$ otherwise.
# We can use a prefix sum to calculate the sum in $O(1)$ time.
# The time complexity is $O(nT)$.
